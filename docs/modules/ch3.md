# Chapter 3: How AI Represents and Reasons

### Tokenization, Embeddings, and Model Types for Enterprise Leaders

## The Airport Café

Imagine yourself in a crowded airport café. Voices overlap in a dozen languages, a barista calls out a misspelled name on a cup, and planes thunder overhead. Amid this noise, you effortlessly pick out your boarding call and know which drink is yours. For machines, the same environment is chaos until they break it down into small, understandable pieces.

That is the starting point for artificial intelligence: tokenization, embeddings, and models. These three ideas form the invisible scaffolding that lets AI interpret the world. This chapter takes you backstage to see how AI represents information and reasons with it. We will keep the discussion intuitive, but concrete enough that you could sit in an executive meeting and ask the right questions about how these systems work.

## Tokens: The Lego Bricks of Language and Perception

AI does not read sentences or view images the way humans do. It breaks them into tokens, the smallest units it can process. For text, tokens might be whole words or fragments of words. For images, they are small patches of pixels. For audio, they are short slices of sound.

A useful metaphor is Lego. Just as a child builds castles, cars, or starships from a limited set of bricks, AI models construct meaning from tokens. By combining a finite set of pieces, they can represent any word, sentence, or even a slang term that appeared for the first time yesterday.

But models have a constraint: they can only hold so many tokens in their “working memory,” known as the context window. Long documents must be split and served piece by piece, like chapters given to a reader who can only remember so much at once. For a manager, this raises practical questions. How will long reports be divided into chunks? What happens if a critical piece of context falls outside the window? And how does the number of tokens drive costs when the system is scaled across thousands of interactions?

## Embeddings: Meaning as Distance

Once tokens are created, the system needs to connect them to meaning. This is where embeddings come in. An embedding is a way of mapping words, sentences, or even whole documents into a numerical space where closeness means similarity.

Imagine wandering through a library where books float in the air, clustering by theme. Mystery novels drift near each other, cookbooks stack together, while astrophysics texts orbit far away. In the same way, embeddings organize language and data into neighborhoods of meaning.

The power of embeddings is visible in everyday systems. Search engines can retrieve “sweat-resistant sport earbuds” when you type “wireless headphones for running,” even though the wording is different. Customer complaints about “refund delays” and “slow returns” can be grouped together even if the phrasing varies. Recommendation engines rely on embeddings to place each user and product in the right part of the neighborhood, so the system can suggest the next likely match.

In enterprises, embeddings also enable retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. Instead of asking a language model to rely on what it learned during training, RAG allows it to fetch information from your company’s actual documents and policies, grounding its answers in trusted data. This approach makes outputs more accurate, more current, and less prone to wandering into fiction.

## Models: Picking the Right Vehicle

Once information has been tokenized and embedded, a model is needed to reason about it. Models are like vehicles; each has its own speed, cost, and terrain.

Some models are the workhorses. Linear regression and decision trees are simple, explainable, and fast. They are excellent when data comes in rows and columns, such as predicting churn, scoring credit risk, or estimating sales.

Others are storytellers. Convolutional neural networks excel at images, spotting cracks in a manufactured part or tumors on an MRI. Recurrent networks, though less common today, were designed to follow sequences such as time series or logs.

At the top are the generals: transformers and large language models. They are voracious readers and writers, able to summarize contracts, draft marketing copy, or answer customer questions in natural language. Some can even combine modalities, processing text and images together. These systems are flexible but also costly, consuming tokens like a jumbo jet burns fuel. The challenge for leaders is not to be dazzled, but to ask: do we really need a jet for this task, or will a bicycle get us there faster and cheaper?

## How Enterprises Put Models to Work

In practice, enterprises deploy models through a few common patterns. Sometimes they rely on zero- or few-shot prompting, which is simply giving the model an instruction and perhaps a few examples to guide it. Other times they use retrieval-augmented generation, where the model consults the company’s own knowledge base before answering. In certain cases, they fine-tune a model so it adopts the company’s preferred style or formats. And often they combine rule-based systems with AI models, using rules to catch the obvious cases and models for the gray areas.

Each approach has tradeoffs in cost, accuracy, and speed. An executive who understands these patterns can better guide vendors and internal teams, making sure the solution fits the problem rather than the other way around.

## Three Enterprise Vignettes

Maria, who manages a factory floor, does not need a generative model. She needs a system that predicts machine failures from vibration data. A gradient boosting model saves her millions by preventing downtime.

Sam, the chief marketing officer, wants to reach customers at scale. By clustering people into neighborhoods of meaning, embeddings and a language model allow his team to send personalized outreach that resonates with each group.

Priya, the chief financial officer, watches the bills. She knows that every token costs money. Her job is to ensure that teams right-size their models, using simple methods where possible and reserving large models for tasks that truly need them.

## The Economics of Tokens

Tokens are not only technical units but also economic ones. More tokens mean more cost and longer processing times. Stuffing a full report into a prompt may feel thorough, but it often leads to higher bills and muddier answers. Retrieval systems that feed only the most relevant chunks are usually more efficient.

Some companies even build routers that send easy queries to small, inexpensive models and escalate complex ones to larger, more powerful systems. This tiered approach keeps costs under control without sacrificing quality.

## Measuring Quality

Judging the quality of an AI system cannot stop at technical benchmarks. Precision, recall, and ranking are useful, but business outcomes matter more. Does the system improve customer satisfaction? Does it cut average handling time? Does it reduce fraud losses or increase conversion rates?

The right evaluation loop ties technical performance to the metrics that leadership already cares about.

## Guardrails and Governance

As powerful as these systems are, they must be guided. Models can hallucinate, generating answers with confidence but no basis in fact. They can reflect biases in their training data. They can even leak sensitive information if retrieval systems are not carefully controlled.

Enterprises need guardrails: requiring citations, redacting personal information, enforcing access control, versioning prompts and models, and keeping humans in the loop for sensitive decisions. AI adoption is not just a technical project but a governance one.

## Closing Thought

If the first chapters introduced AI as the electricity of the enterprise, this chapter shows the wiring diagram. Tokens are the wires, embeddings are the circuits of meaning, and models are the appliances you plug in. Your role as a leader is not to solder wires but to decide which appliances deserve power, which rooms need lighting, and how to prevent short circuits.

AI will not replace human judgment. It will extend it, giving leaders sharper instruments, faster feedback, and new creative possibilities for how enterprises learn, adapt, and thrive.
